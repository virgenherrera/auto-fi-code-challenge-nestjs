# Coding Challenge
## 1 to 2 hours - NodeJS backend
You work on a product that receives potentially large files in CSV format, process them and import their data into our database. However, providers do not all use the same layout of columns. The order may differ between providers, they may only send a subset of the columns,
or they may include additional columns we do not wish to capture.

## Task
Build an API with a single endpoint that accepts a file upload in the CSV format and the provider.
name that sent the file, looks up a configuration defining the column layout and parses the CSV.
into either a file or - as a stretch goal - into an in-memory database (see below).
The columns we care about are defined below in the “Columns” section.

### Columns
- UUID
- VIN (alphanumerical vehicle id)
- Make
- Model
- Mileage
- Year
- Price
- Zip Code
- Create Date
- Update Date

## You are responsible for:
* choosing the framework/libraries/architecture you’ll be using
* defining the format of the configuration file and how it is stored/loaded.

### Stretch goals
* use an in-memory database(e.g. SQLite, mongodb-memory-server) instead of a file for
storage
* provide appropriate tests ensuring the desired outcome
Document any assumptions and design decisions you have made.
